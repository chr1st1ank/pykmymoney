# Pykmymoney
Python bindings to read [kmymoney](https://kmymoney.org/) files.

## Installing the development environment

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) which is based on
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). So first get these tools.

Then go to the project root and type:
```shell script
poetry install
```

If you need the path of your python environment to configure your IDE do:
```shell script
poetry env info
```
